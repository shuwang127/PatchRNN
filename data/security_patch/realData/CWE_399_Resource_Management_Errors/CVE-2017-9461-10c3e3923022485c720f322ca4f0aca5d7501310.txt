Subject: [PATCH] s3: smbd: Don't loop infinitely on bad-symlink resolution.

In the FILE_OPEN_IF case we have O_CREAT, but not
O_EXCL. Previously we went into a loop trying first
~(O_CREAT|O_EXCL), and if that returned ENOENT
try (O_CREAT|O_EXCL). We kept looping indefinately
until we got an error, or the file was created or
opened.

The big problem here is dangling symlinks. Opening
without O_NOFOLLOW means both bad symlink
and missing path return -1, ENOENT from open(). As POSIX
is pathname based it's not possible to tell
the difference between these two cases in a
non-racy way, so change to try only two attempts before
giving up.

We don't have this problem for the O_NOFOLLOW
case as we just return NT_STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND
mapped from the ELOOP POSIX error and immediately
returned.

Unroll the loop logic to two tries instead.
