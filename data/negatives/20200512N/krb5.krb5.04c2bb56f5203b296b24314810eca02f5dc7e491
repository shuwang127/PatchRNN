    Fix KDC/kadmind startup on some IPv4-only systems
    
    getaddrinfo(NULL, ...) may yield an IPv6 wildcard address on IPv4-only
    systems, and creating a socket for that address may result in an
    EAFNOSUPPORT error.  Tolerate that error as long as we can bind at
    least one socket for the address.
