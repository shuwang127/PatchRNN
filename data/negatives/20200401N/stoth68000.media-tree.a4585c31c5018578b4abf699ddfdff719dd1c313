    [media] marvell-ccic: don't break long lines
    
    Due to the 80-cols restrictions, and latter due to checkpatch
    warnings, several strings were broken into multiple lines. This
    is not considered a good practice anymore, as it makes harder
    to grep for strings at the source code.
    
    As we're right now fixing other drivers due to KERN_CONT, we need
    to be able to identify what printk strings don't end with a "\n".
    It is a way easier to detect those if we don't break long lines.
    
    So, join those continuation lines.
    
    The patch was generated via the script below, and manually
    adjusted if needed.
