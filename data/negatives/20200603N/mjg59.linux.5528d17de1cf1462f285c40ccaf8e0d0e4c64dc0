    dm raid1: fail writes if errors are not handled and log fails
    
    If the mirror log fails when the handle_errors option was not selected
    and there is no remaining valid mirror leg, writes return success even
    though they weren't actually written to any device.  This patch
    completes them with EIO instead.
    
    This code path is taken:
    do_writes:
            bio_list_merge(&ms->failures, &sync);
    do_failures:
            if (!get_valid_mirror(ms)) (false)
            else if (errors_handled(ms)) (false)
            else bio_endio(bio, 0);
    
    The logic in do_failures is based on presuming that the write was already
    tried: if it succeeded at least on one leg (without handle_errors) it
    is reported as success.
